    "question_answer": "**Question: How does the `WITH` clause enhance SQL query functionality in Apache Flink, and what are the limitations of data types that can be used in such queries according to the SQL documentation?**\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe `WITH` clause in Apache Flink's SQL provides a powerful way to enhance query functionality by allowing the definition of Common Table Expressions (CTEs). CTEs are essentially temporary result sets that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. They serve as a mechanism to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into more manageable parts, improving both readability and maintainability.\n\nFor instance, consider the following example where a CTE named `orders_with_total` is used to compute the total price for orders, including taxes:\n\n```sql\nWITH orders_with_total AS (\n    SELECT order_id, price + tax AS total\n    FROM Orders\n)\nSELECT order_id, SUM(total)\nFROM orders_with_total\nGROUP BY order_id;\n```\n\nIn this query, `orders_with_total` is a CTE that calculates the total order price by adding the `price` and `tax` for each order. This CTE is then used in a `SELECT` statement to aggregate the total values by `order_id`.\n\nHowever, while the `WITH` clause offers these advantages, there are certain limitations in terms of the data types that can be used in SQL queries within Flink. According to the SQL documentation, some data types are not yet supported in SQL queries, particularly in cast expressions or literals. These include:\n\n- `STRING`\n- `BYTES`\n- `RAW`\n- `TIME(p) WITHOUT TIME ZONE`\n- `TIME(p) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE`\n- `TIMESTAMP(p) WITHOUT TIME ZONE`\n- `TIMESTAMP(p) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE`\n- `ARRAY`\n- `MULTISET`\n- `ROW`\n\nThese limitations imply that while defining and using CTEs, care must be taken to avoid using unsupported data types in expressions that involve casting or defining literals. Instead, users should rely on supported data types to ensure query execution without errors.\n\nIn summary, the `WITH` clause significantly enhances query functionality in Flink SQL by allowing the use of CTEs for better query organization and readability. Nevertheless, users must be aware of the existing limitations regarding unsupported data types to effectively utilize this feature.",
