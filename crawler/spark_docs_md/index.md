Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R,
and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including
[Spark SQL](sql-programming-guide.html) for SQL and structured data processing,
[pandas API on Spark](api/python/getting_started/quickstart_ps.html) for pandas workloads,
[MLlib](ml-guide.html) for machine learning,
[GraphX](graphx-programming-guide.html) for graph processing,
and [Structured Streaming](structured-streaming-programming-guide.html)
for incremental computation and stream processing.
