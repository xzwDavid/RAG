# 3. Conventions


The following conventions are used in the synopsis of a command: brackets (`[`and`]`) indicate optional parts. Braces (`{`and`}`) and vertical lines (`|`) indicate that you must choose one alternative. Dots (`...`) mean that the preceding element can be repeated. All other symbols, including parentheses, should be taken literally.


Where it enhances the clarity, SQL commands are preceded by the prompt`=>`, and shell commands are preceded by the prompt`$`. Normally, prompts are not shown, though.


An*administrator*is generally a person who is in charge of installing and running the server. A*user*could be anyone who is using, or wants to use, any part of thePostgreSQLsystem. These terms should not be interpreted too narrowly; this book does not have fixed presumptions about system administration procedures.
