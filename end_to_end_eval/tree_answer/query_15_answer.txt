To deploy a Spark application on a Kubernetes cluster with appropriate configurations for dependencies, security, and resource allocation, you need to follow several steps that integrate information from all the given documents.

1. **Packaging and Submitting the Application:**
   - **Packaging Dependencies:** First, package your Spark application and its dependencies. If you're using a language supported by PySpark, such as Python or Scala, bundle your code into a `.py`, `.zip`, or `.egg` file. Use the `--py-files` option in `spark-submit` to include these files in the deployment. For Java/Scala applications, package your code into a JAR file, and use the `--jars` option.
   - **Using spark-submit:** Utilize the `spark-submit` script to deploy your application to the Kubernetes cluster. Specify the class, master URL, deploy mode, and any necessary Spark configurations. For example:
     ```bash
     ./bin/spark-submit \
       --class <main-class> \
       --master k8s://<kubernetes-api-url> \
       --deploy-mode cluster \
       --conf spark.executor.memory=4g \
       --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=<your-spark-image> \
       <application-jar>
     ```

2. **Configuring Spark Properties for Kubernetes:**
   - **Resource Management:** Configure Spark properties to manage resources effectively. Use `spark.executor.cores`, `spark.executor.memory`, and `spark.executor.instances` to define the resources each executor will use.
   - **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Enable dynamic resource allocation to adjust resources based on workload. This is particularly useful in a shared Kubernetes cluster where resources can be reallocated as needed.
   - **Persistent Volume Claims:** For long-running applications, use Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to provide permanent storage. This is essential for maintaining state across multiple executor instances.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - **User Identity and Permissions:** Spark applications on Kubernetes should be run with a non-root user. Configure the `spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName` to ensure the correct user identity is used.
   - **Volume Mount Security:** Restrict the use of `hostPath` volumes due to their security vulnerabilities. Utilize Kubernetes security policies to control access and mounting of volumes.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Use Spark's web UI (accessible via port 4040) to monitor your application’s execution on the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Ensure that logging is configured correctly for your application, with specific directives for each log level (`info`, `warn`, `error`) as needed.

By following these steps, you can effectively deploy and manage a Spark application on a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that it is configured for optimal performance and security. This approach takes advantage of Kubernetes’ powerful orchestration capabilities and Spark’s flexible configuration options.
