To effectively monitor and manage a Spark application running on a cluster using `spark-submit`, you need to understand the application's architecture, deploy it correctly, and utilize Spark's monitoring tools, particularly the web UI and history server.\n\n1. **Understanding Spark Architecture**:\n   - A Spark application consists of a *driver program* and *executor processes*. The driver program, managed by the `SparkContext`, coordinates tasks and distributes them to executors for computation.\n   - Executors are acquired by connecting to a cluster manager, which can be Spark's standalone, YARN, or Kubernetes, and these executors run tasks and store data for your application.\n\n2. **Deploying Applications with `spark-submit`**:\n   - Use the `spark-submit` script to launch your Spark application on a cluster. This script provides a uniform interface for different cluster managers, allowing you to specify the main class, master URL, deploy mode, and configuration properties.\n   - When submitting the application, choose between `client` or `cluster` mode based on the network proximity of the driver to the worker nodes. For instance, if running from a gateway machine close to worker nodes, `client` mode is suitable; otherwise, use `cluster` mode.\n\n3. **Monitoring Applications Using Web UI**:\n   - Each Spark application has an associated web UI that runs on port 4040 by default. This UI provides details about the running tasks, stages, executor status, and storage usage.\n   - Access the UI via `http://<driver-node>:4040`, but note that multiple SparkContexts on the same host will bind to successive ports (4041, 4042, etc.).\n   - To retain this information after the application has completed, enable event logging by setting `spark.eventLog.enabled` to true and specify a log directory with `spark.eventLog.dir`.\n\n4. **Utilizing the History Server**:\n   - For viewing application metrics after they have completed, use Spark's history server, which reconstructs the UI from stored event logs.\n   - Start the history server using `./sbin/start-history-server.sh` and access it via `http://<server-url>:18080`. Configure it to point to the event log directory using `spark.history.fs.logDirectory`.\n   - Enable rolling event logs to manage long-running applications effectively, thereby reducing the size of log files and improving replay performance in the history server.\n\nBy integrating these elements, you can deploy, monitor, and manage Spark applications more effectively, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently on your chosen cluster environment.
