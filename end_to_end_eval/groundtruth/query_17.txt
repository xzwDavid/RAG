The Spark high availability setup is designed to ensure continuity and recovery in case of a Master node failure by utilizing two primary recovery modes: ZooKeeper-based and FILESYSTEM-based. Each mode has its specific configuration requirements and operational characteristics:\n\n### ZooKeeper-based Recovery Mode\n\n**Functionality:**\n- **Leader Election and Recovery:** When the current leader (Master node) fails, ZooKeeper facilitates an election to choose a new leader. The new Master recovers the previous state of the cluster and resumes scheduling new applications within 1-2 minutes. This process ensures minimal disruption, as only the scheduling of new applications is affected.\n- **Registration and Notification:** Applications and Workers register with the Master and have their state stored in ZooKeeper. This allows the new leader to seamlessly notify them of the change in leadership without the applications and Workers needing to be aware of the new Master's existence at startup.\n\n**Configuration:**\n- **Enable Recovery Mode:** Set `spark.deploy.recoveryMode` to `ZOOKEEPER` in `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` in the `spark-env` file.\n- **ZooKeeper Settings:** Configure `spark.deploy.zookeeper.*` settings to correctly point to your ZooKeeper cluster. This includes specifying the ZooKeeper URL and directory.\n- **Multiple Masters:** Start multiple Master processes on different nodes with the same ZooKeeper configuration to ensure high availability. Ensure all Masters are correctly configured to prevent them from independently scheduling as leaders.\n\n### FILESYSTEM-based Recovery Mode\n\n**Functionality:**\n- **Single-node Recovery:** This mode is not for high-availability but provides a way to restart the Master node with its state preserved on a local file system. This mode writes enough state information to a specified directory to allow recovery upon a Master restart.\n\n**Configuration:**\n- **Enable Recovery Mode:** Set `spark.deploy.recoveryMode` to `FILESYSTEM` in `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`.\n- **Specify Recovery Directory:** Define `spark.deploy.recoveryDirectory` to specify the directory where the recovery state is stored. This directory must be accessible from the Master's perspective.\n\n### Operational Notes\n\n- **High Availability with ZooKeeper:** For production-level high availability, ZooKeeper is preferred as it supports multi-node setups, ensuring continuity even if a Master node fails.\n- **Single-node Setup with FILESYSTEM:** Use FILESYSTEM mode if you only need to restart the Master process without a full high availability setup. It's a simpler setup but doesn't offer the robustness of multi-node recovery.\n\nIn summary, Spark's high availability can be achieved through proper configuration of ZooKeeper or FILESYSTEM modes. ZooKeeper enables dynamic leader election and state recovery across multiple nodes, ensuring minimal disruption to running applications, while FILESYSTEM mode provides basic recovery for single-node setups.
