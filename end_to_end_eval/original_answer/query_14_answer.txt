To optimize a Spark application involving both batch processing and real-time streaming data, and to ensure efficient resource allocation and performance across different deployment modes, while integrating machine learning models and SQL queries, one needs to leverage Spark's various components and deployment strategies as follows:

1. **Framework Selection**:
   - For batch processing, utilize Spark SQL, Datasets, and DataFrames to handle structured data efficiently. These APIs provide optimizations that are superior to the older RDD-based API.
   - For real-time streaming data, use Structured Streaming, which is built on top of DataFrames and Datasets, providing a more modern approach than the legacy Spark Streaming with DStreams.

2. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Utilize MLlib, Spark's machine learning library, to apply machine learning models on both batch and streaming data. MLlib can process data stored in HDFS or other storage systems supported by Spark.
   - If the machine learning models are complex and require frequent updates, consider using Mate, Spark's machine learning server, to deploy and manage models.

3. **Deployment Modes**:
   - Choose a deployment mode based on the cluster infrastructure and application requirements. Spark can be deployed in various modes, including standalone, YARN, Kubernetes, and Amazon EC2.
   - For cloud-based deployments, EC2 mode can be quickly set up using scripts provided by the community, while Kubernetes is ideal for containerized applications.
   - For on-premises clusters, standalone mode can be used, or Spark can be integrated with Hadoop via YARN.

4. **Resource Allocation and Optimization**:
   - Use Spark's built-in job scheduling to manage resource allocation across multiple applications. The scheduler can distribute resources based on various policies, such as FIFO or round-robin.
   - Consider using dynamic resource allocation to optimize resource usage, especially for batch jobs that have variable resource requirements.
   - Leverage the Tuning Guide to optimize Spark configurations, such as memory usage and executor settings, for better performance.

5. **SQL Queries and Data Manipulation**:
   - Use Spark SQL to perform complex SQL queries on both batch and streaming data. Spark SQL can handle data stored in Hive tables or other structured data sources.
   - Integrate with JDBC/ODBC databases for accessing external data sources in real-time.

6. **Data Storage and Access**:
   - Store data in HDFS or other distributed file systems supported by Spark for efficient access by multiple applications.
   - Use Spark's RDD caching mechanisms to store data in memory across the cluster for quick access by multiple tasks.

By combining these components and strategies, one can build a robust Spark application that efficiently processes both batch and streaming data, applies machine learning models, and leverages SQL queries, all while optimizing resource usage and performance across various deployment environments.
