Deploying a Spark application to a cluster involves several steps, including packaging, submitting, and configuring the application, as well as understanding the cluster environment and deployment modes. Here's a detailed guide combining insights from the provided documents:

1. **Packaging the Application:**
   - **Language Specifics:** 
     - **Java/Scala:** 
       - Developers should package their applications into JAR files. Third-party libraries can be included using the `--packages` option in `spark-submit`.
       - Example command to submit a Java application:
         ```bash
         ./bin/spark-submit --class path.to.your.Class --master masterURL --deploy-mode deployMode app.jar
         ```
     - **Python:**
       - Applications can be packaged as `.py` files or as `.zip` files. The `spark-submit` script is used for submission.
       - Example command to submit a Python application:
         ```bash
         ./bin/spark-submit --master masterURL --deploy-mode deployMode path/to/application.py
         ```

2. **Submitting the Application to the Cluster:**
   - Use the `spark-submit` script to submit the application to the cluster. This script handles the inclusion of Spark libraries and can manage different deployment modes.
   - Example command to submit an application using `spark-submit`:
     ```bash
     ./bin/spark-submit --master masterURL --deploy-mode deployMode --conf conf1=val1 --conf conf2=val2 app.jar
     ```

3. **Configuring the Application:**
   - **Spark Properties:** 
     - These control application settings like master URL, application name, and other key-value pairs. They can be set using a `SparkConf` object or through the `spark-submit` command.
     - Example of setting properties in a `SparkConf` object:
       ```scala
       val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster("local[2]").setAppName("CountingSheep")
       val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
       ```
   - **Dynamic Configuration:**
     - Allows for specifying configurations at runtime using command-line options with `spark-submit`.

4. **Launching the Application:**
   - **Cluster Mode:** Determines where the driver process runs. In "client" mode, the driver runs on the machine submitting the application, while in "cluster" mode, it runs within the cluster.
   - **Deployment Modes:** Affect how resources are allocated and managed. Understanding these modes is crucial for resource optimization.

5. **Testing the Application:**
   - **Unit Testing:** Can be done using frameworks like JUnit or PyTest by creating a `SparkContext` with the master URL set to "local".
   - **Example of a unit test in Scala:**
     ```scala
     import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
     import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
     import org.junit.runner.RunWith
     import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitRunner

     @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])
     class ExampleTest {
       val conf = new SparkConf().setMaster("local[2]").setAppName("TestApp")
       val sc = new SparkContext(conf)

       @Test
       def testSparkContext() {
         assert(sc != null)
       }
     }
     ```

6. **Optimizing the Application:**
   - **Configuration Tuning:** 
     - **Memory Management:** Adjusting `spark.executor.memory` and `spark.executor.cores` can help optimize resource usage.
     - **Data Serialization:** Using Kryo serialization can improve performance over Java serialization.
   - **Job Scheduling:** 
     - **Fair Scheduling:** Ensures resources are allocated fairly across applications.
     - **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Allows applications to release resources when not in use and request them when needed, optimizing resource usage in a shared environment.

7. **Considerations for Different Cluster Environments:**
   - **Standalone Cluster:** Simple to set up and manage, suitable for small clusters.
   - **YARN:** For Hadoop-based environments, provides resource management and scheduling capabilities.
   - **Kubernetes
