To configure and run a Spark application in Python on a cluster with efficient shared variable usage and proper memory management, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure compatibility by using Python 3.8+ as Spark supports Python 3.8 and above. The same Python version should be used on both the driver and worker nodes. You can set the Python version using the `PYSPARK_PYTHON` environment variable. For example:
     ```bash
     $ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3.8 bin/pyspark
     ```

2. **Launching Spark Application:**
   - Use the `spark-submit` script to launch your Spark application. This script sets up the necessary classpath and supports various cluster managers. Here’s an example command to submit a Python application:
     ```bash
     ./bin/spark-submit \
       --master <master-url> \
       --deploy-mode <deploy-mode> \
       --conf <key>=<value> \
       <application-py-file> \
       [application-arguments]
     ```
   - Ensure that the `master-url` is correctly set to point to the cluster's master node, which could be a `spark://`, `yarn`, `k8s`, or `mesos` URL depending on the cluster manager.

3. **Shared Variables:**
   - Use broadcast variables when you need to share a large dataset across nodes without sending it with each task. This is more efficient than sending copies of the dataset to each executor:
     ```python
     broadcastVar = sc.broadcast([1, 2, 3])
     ```
   - Use accumulators for aggregating information from worker nodes back to the driver, such as counters or sums. Accumulators are only used for commutative and associative operations:
     ```python
     accum = sc.accumulator(0)
     for i in range(10):
         accum.add(1)
     ```

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Spark automatically handles memory management for objects serialized using Kryo serialization, which is faster and more compact than Python's default `pickle`. To ensure efficient memory usage, register your classes with Kryo:
     ```python
     from pyspark.serializers import KryoRegistrator
     kryo = KryoRegistrator(sc.getConf())
     kryo.registerKryoClasses((YourClass1, YourClass2))
     ```
   - If your application allocates a lot of memory, configure Spark to use off-heap memory for RDD storage by setting `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled` to `true`.

5. **Fault Tolerance and Executor Decommissioning:**
   - Spark automatically handles the reallocation of tasks when executors fail, ensuring that the application can continue to run without interruption.
   - When decommissioning an executor, Spark will attempt to reallocate its tasks to other executors. If all tasks cannot be reallocated, the executor will be marked as `UNRECOVERABLE`.
   - Configure `spark.executor.maxNumFailures` to specify how many times an executor can fail before being marked as `UNRECOVERABLE`.

6. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Use Spark’s web UI (typically available at `http://<driver-node>:4040`) to monitor the status of your application, including task execution and resource usage.
   - Enable structured logging to view application logs in JSON format, facilitating easier querying and analysis:
     ```bash
     --conf "spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled=true"
     ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your Spark application in Python is efficiently configured and run on a cluster, with proper shared variable usage, memory management, and fault tolerance. This setup allows the application to scale and handle the dynamic environment of a distributed cluster.
