To optimize the processing and performance of a Spark application that involves counting the maximum number of words in a line and computing word frequencies, while deploying it on a cluster, you need to leverage Spark's caching mechanisms and configuration settings. Here's how you can achieve this in a comprehensive manner, referencing the content from all the provided documents:

1. **Understanding the Dataset API:**
   - The application should utilize the Dataset API as it provides richer optimizations compared to the RDD API. The Dataset API allows you to work with structured data with type safety, which is particularly useful for Spark SQL operations.

2. **Transforming and Caching Data:**
   - Use transformations like `map`, `flatMap`, and `groupByKey` to process your text data. For example, you can use `flatMap` to split lines into words and `groupByKey` followed by `count` to compute word frequencies.
   - Cache the dataset using `cache()` to improve performance for repeated accesses. This is crucial if the dataset is reused multiple times, as Spark stores it in memory across the cluster.

3. **Configuration Settings:**
   - Configure Spark properties to optimize serialization and memory usage. Use `spark.serializer` to set the serialization method to Kryo for efficiency. Kryo is faster and more compact than Java serialization.
   - Adjust `spark.memory.fraction` and `spark.memory.storageFraction` to manage the balance between execution and storage memory. This ensures that enough memory is allocated for caching without compromising execution performance.

4. **Deploying on a Cluster:**
   - Package your application and submit it using `spark-submit`. This script supports different cluster managers like YARN and Kubernetes, which help manage resources efficiently.
   - Use `spark-submit` options like `--master`, `--deploy-mode`, and `--conf` to specify cluster configurations. For instance, `--master` can be set to "yarn" for YARN clusters.

5. **Example Code in Different Languages:**
   - **Python:**
     ```python
     from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf

     conf = SparkConf().setAppName("WordCountApp").setMaster("local[2]")
     sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)

     lines = sc.textFile("path/to/textfile.txt")
     words = lines.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))
     pairs = words.map(lambda word: (word, 1))
     wordCounts = pairs.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)

     wordCounts.cache()

     print(wordCounts.collect())

     sc.stop()
     ```
   - **Scala:**
     ```scala
     import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
     import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
     import org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset
     import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

     val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("WordCountApp").setMaster("local[2]")
     val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
     val sqlContext = new org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext(sc)

     val lines = sc.textFile("path/to/textfile.txt")
     val words = lines.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))
     val pairs = words.map(word => (word, 1))
     val wordCounts = pairs.reduceByKey((x, y) => x + y)

     wordCounts.cache()

     val result = sqlContext.read.json("path/to/jsonfile.json")
     result.show()

     sc.stop()
     ```

6. **Advanced Optimizations:**
   - Enable adaptive query execution to dynamically adjust resources based on workload.
   - Tune Spark properties for specific operations like `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` for optimizing join operations.

By combining these strategies, you can efficiently optimize the processing and performance of your Spark application while leveraging the full power of distributed computing environments.
